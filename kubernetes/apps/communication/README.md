# Communication

Here we have:

- notification apps (tied to monitoring)
- selfhosted social media (like mastodon/bluesky...)
- blogs

## Blogs

This should contain public content stuff like blogs. It should:

1. replace laurivan.com
2. replace sillyjokes.???
3. Have a content creation thing
4. is available on envoy-external (aka web-accessible)

**Notes**:

1. Depends on DB and a robust backup
2. must contain only production-ready stuff
3. Need to figure out how to do it for multiple domanis...
