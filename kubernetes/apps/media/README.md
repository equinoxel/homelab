# Introduction

This shall contain all media-related applications:

- Plex
- *arr stuff
- tatuuli - still don't know what purpose it serves
- digital library things
- transcoding for optimisation to available media (e.g. 1080p right now, 4k in the future)
- maybe create a decay algorithm to remove old and unwatched stuff

Can also contain
- mermaid ui
- figma equivalent
- immich (it will most likely be here)

**NOTES**:

1. in principle, stuff should be exposed on the internal gateway
2. mirror and replace the current "services" vm which is full of docker containers
3. it depends on a successful connection via NFS to the storage machine
