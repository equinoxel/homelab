{"id":"homelab-5wg","title":"Fix network configuration conflicts (etcd + routes)","description":"Multiple network configuration issues on the cluster nodes:\n\n**Issue 1: etcd Peer URL Conflict**\nNode esxi-2cu-8g-01 (10.0.0.146) has duplicate peer URLs in etcd (10.0.0.128 and 10.0.0.146), causing \"Peer URLs already exists\" error. Node is currently unreachable.\n\n**Issue 2: Network Route Conflict**\nNodes are showing route conflict errors:\n```\nerror adding route: netlink receive: file exists\ngateway: 10.0.0.129\n```\n\nThis is because nodes were previously configured with `/24` subnet and gateway `10.0.0.1`, but now configured with `/27` subnet and gateway `10.0.0.129`. Old routes persist.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nConfiguration changed from:\n- Old: 10.0.0.0/24, gateway 10.0.0.1\n- New: 10.0.0.128/27, gateway 10.0.0.129\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Reset ALL nodes to clear old network config\n2. Re-apply Talos configuration\n3. Bootstrap cluster fresh\n\nCommands:\n```bash\n# Reset each node\ntalosctl -n 10.0.0.145 reset --graceful=false --reboot\ntalosctl -n 10.0.0.146 reset --graceful=false --reboot  \ntalosctl -n 10.0.0.147 reset --graceful=false --reboot\n\n# Wait for nodes to boot into maintenance mode, then:\ntask bootstrap:talos\n```","acceptance_criteria":"- Member ceeb52e03fde8032 is removed from etcd cluster\n- Node 10.0.0.146 is reset and reconfigured\n- Node rejoins etcd cluster with correct peer URL\n- `talosctl etcd members` shows only one peer URL per member\n- All three nodes are healthy in etcd cluster","notes":"**Recommended Fix: Full Cluster Reset (Option 1)**\n\nAll nodes are currently offline. Once nodes are back online, execute:\n\n```bash\n# Reset all nodes to maintenance mode\ntalosctl -n 10.0.0.145 reset --graceful=false --reboot --insecure\ntalosctl -n 10.0.0.146 reset --graceful=false --reboot --insecure\ntalosctl -n 10.0.0.147 reset --graceful=false --reboot --insecure\n\n# Wait for nodes to boot into maintenance mode (~2-3 min)\n# Verify with: nmap -Pn -n -p 50000 10.0.0.145-147 -vv\n\n# Re-bootstrap\ntask bootstrap:talos\ntask bootstrap:apps\n```\n\nThis is the cleanest approach to clear all lingering network config and etcd state issues.
